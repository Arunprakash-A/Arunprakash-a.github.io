## Application of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to Image compression
* In this video, I show you have SVD could be applied to images (which are essentially a matrix of elements)
* We can use rank-k approximation to represent an image which eventually leads to image compression

## Vector Space: Independence, Span, Projections (in Tamil)
* If you are in a hurry to conceptually understand the core Linear algebra concepts, then this video is for you.
* Prerequisites: Matrix, Vector, matrix-vector product

## Approximation is all you need: Fourier Transform 
* Engineers only do approximations! 
* In this video, I introduce you to one of the most profound mathematical transformations called the Fourier Transform.
* If you are too rigid about definitions, then in this video I talk about "The Fourier series".
