<h2>Arun Prakash A</h2>
<h4>Instructor | Researcher, IIT Madras</h4>
<P> I am excited to solve complex problems in <em> Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing </em>  by using deep learning models. I have been coding in <strong> Python </strong> with its powerful supporting packages like <em> Numpy, OpenCV, Pytorch and Scipy,</em> to name a few. </P>
<p> In addition to deep learning, I also have strong knowledge of <em> Signal Processing algorithms used for Image and Speech processing </em>. I learned a lot about the approach to science and engineering from books written by <strong> Richard Feynman and Richard Hamming</strong>.   </p>
