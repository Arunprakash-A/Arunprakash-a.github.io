For the past three months, I have been quite busy building course materials (lecture slides, graded assignments and coding assignments) for the first offering of the course Introduction to Large Language Models by Prof.Mitesh Khapra. It has been challenging work as we have committed to offer the course in the JAN 2024 term. Every challenge is an opportunity. I have gone through a lot of research papers (a few of those listed in the previous blog posts) carefully. No other opportunities could enable us to dive deep into various concepts in the world of transformers. In the process of building materials, you will get to know all the details of the concept you learn. 

Though I created materials, they were thoroughly reviewed/re-shaped by the Prof., a team of research scholars and domain experts at AI4Bharat. It always motivated me to even be more mindful of the words that I put into the lecture slides. Still a lot more to read (of course, it will never end!). Finally, we have built a beautiful course (will keep adding more lectures).
