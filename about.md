 Thank you for coming here! Like you, I am also intrigued by problems in the field of<em> NLP, CV and Speech </em>. I work with the transformer architecture and its variations and all the concepts revolving around it! I build models using native <em> Pytorch </em> (for more customization) and <em> Hugging Face (with Pytorch backend)</em>.

 You can find the notebooks [here](https://github.com/Arunprakash-A/DL-Pytorch-Workshop) if you want to get started with Pytorch and HF. Finally, I am a GPU poor guy having access to only V100, A100 and L4 nodes which prevents me from pre-training language models from scratch on large-scale datasets! 

My journey started with traditional <em> Signal Processing algorithms</em>. I was fascinated by the beauty of Fourier Transformation (FT) applied to linear time-invariant systems. I didn't appreciate the power of the Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm when I learned it for the first time in adaptive signal processing algorithms. A paradigm shift happened when I witnessed the extention of GD (backpropagation algorithm) taking the entire vision field by storm. 

I started learning neural networks in detail only after 2015. Like FT, I was fascinated by the attention mechanism and its clever application in the transformer architecture. I learned a lot about the approach to science and engineering from books written by <strong> Richard Feynman and Richard Hamming</strong>.
