## Application of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to Image compression
* In this video, I show you have SVD could be applied to images (which are essentialy a matrix of elements)
* We can use rank-k approximation to represent an image which eventually leads to image compression

## Vector Space: Indendence, Span, Projections (in Tamil)
* If you are in a hurry to conceptually understand the core Linear algebra concepts, then this video is for you.
* Prerequisites: Matrix, Vector, matrix-vector product

## Approximation is all you need : Fourier Transform 
* Engineers do approximation!. 
* In this video, I introduce you to the one of the profound mathematical transformation called Fourier Transform.
* If you are too rigor about definitions, then in this vide0 I talk about "Fourier series".
